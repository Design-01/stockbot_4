Please complete the class look at the dock string hopefully it is clear enough. \\nYou must maintain the compute row method as this class inherits from signals which uses a run method which calls this compute method for each row.\\nFor this particular class it needs to count the number of touches of a line which can be a resistance or support line it can be a trend line or it can be the upper or lower bounds of consolidation zones\\nThe the function of the line is not necessarily important but now that some lines will be horizontal meaning that they are maintaining the same price level and other lines such as trend lines will be on a slope which means every single bar has a different value\\n\\nTo add further complexity each line line has its own separate column within the pandas data frame. So even though I have multiple say trend lines or consolidation zones within my data frame they all have their own columns for each line \\n  The way to Identify the columns will be because of the naming or have a similar starting name. eg MTREND or RECT  '"
